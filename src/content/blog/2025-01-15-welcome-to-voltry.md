We're excited to introduce Voltry, the next generation of power quality monitoring and forecasting. Our AI-powered platform helps data centers and mission-critical facilities prevent costly downtime before it happens.

## Why Voltry?

Power quality issues cost data centers an average of $500K+ per year in equipment failures, downtime, and IEEE 519 penalties. Traditional monitoring systems can only tell you what's happening right now - but what if you could predict problems before they occur?

## The Power of AI Forecasting

With Product 1, our AI models analyze your facility's power quality patterns and predict issues 24-72 hours in advance with 95% accuracy. This gives your team time to take preventive action, avoiding costly emergencies.

## Privacy-First Approach

Unlike traditional solutions that require you to share sensitive data, Voltry uses federated learning. Your raw data never leaves your facility, while you still benefit from insights across our network of 50+ data centers.
